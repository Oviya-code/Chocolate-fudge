Place the chocolate chips,condensed milk and butter in a glass bowl
I have asked you to cut the butter into pieces as it will melt better
Microwave these items for 30 seconds and stir
If there are still chunks, repeat this step again
It is better to let the chocolate melt slowly from the heat of the bowl than to microwave it too much. If it is microwaved too much, it will turn hard
If the choco chips are frozen it might take a longer time for them to melt.
Once everything is melted and gooey add the vanilla and salt
The fudge might not look smooth and creamy.But when it is all set and hardened it will be. So it is ok if it is thick and hard to stir
Line an 8Ã—8 baking dish with tin foil or parchment paper
Spray with non-stick cooking spray
Pour the fudge mixture into the dish and smooth out evenly.Scoop out the extra from the bowl with a spoon
Refrigerate it for atleast two hours
When the fudge is firm, pull the whole thing out of the baking dish and peel off the parchment paper or tinfoil
Cut it into squares or any other shape you want like hearts,diamonds,etc.
Your snack is ready!!
